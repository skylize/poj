# `skylize/poj`

Minimalist combinator library for generic parsing. Views a parser as no more than application of a function over a map. Provides some core combinators and pointfree monadic functions to help you out.

## Installation

Add the following to your `deps.edn` file
```
com.github.skylize/poj {:git/tag "v0.1.0 :git/sha ""}
```

## Usage

A "parser" can be as simple as a function that takes a state and returns a state of the same form. In `poj`, that state looks like

```clojure
{ :source "probably a string"
  :pos 0                       ; positional index in the source
  :win, nil                    ; optional success
  :loss nil }                  ; optional failure
```

A parser is any function that can read from `:source` and return a new state. A `:win` represents a success state, and a `:loss` represents a failure. Most parsing functions attempt parsing the `:source` string from the current position `:pos`, but you're free to do otherwise as needed. If parsing succeeds, `assoc` that success as a `:win`. If it fails, `assoc` to a `:loss`.

Since it's just maps and functions, you can easily add or change data as needed (including overwriting the source if that serves you ðŸ§™). But the algebraic library helps with elegant transformations. For example, you could use `fmap` to convert a simple string match into a more detailed AST node.

```clojure
; poj/string is a one of the provided parsers that just matches exact string.
(let [state {:pos 25 :source "Wow! Changing results is pretty easy."}]
  ((fmap (fn [s] {:type  :string
                  :value s})
         (poj/string "pretty"))
   state))
```

You can find some core parsers to simplify your life. Some examples include ... **TODO** ... and the all powerful `poj/regex` to throw at any regular expression you can devise at the problem.

Importantly, `clobber` offers a collection of basic functorial and monadic tranformations. These functions are more discovered than imposed, relying solely on the existence of map keys to behave correctly. Parsers are still just functions, and results still just maps.
